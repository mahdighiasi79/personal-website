                    <p>I was born in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandar-e_Mahshahr" target="_blank">small
                            city</a> in the southwest of Iran. The city is famous for hosting a massive
                        petroleum reservoir, and there was a refinery factory, built close to the city, where my father
                        worked as a civil engineer. Growing up in a city with numerous large factories brought up the
                        question for me, “ How large-scale systems are built ? ”.</p>
                    <p>I grew up with the dream of building massive systems that involve so many people to build and
                        maintain them. Despite the fact that the people living in my city back then usually pursued a
                        profession related to extracting oil, I was more interested in technology and computer systems.
                        During high school, I was introduced to computer engineering as a subject to study at
                        university. My goal first was to get a B.S. in computer engineering and gain the required
                        knowledge and skills to make a difference in the tech area and build systems that will benefit
                        so many people.</p>
                    <p>I got ranked in the top 0.5% in Iran's National University Entrance Exam, and I decided to go to
                        AUT studying Computer Engineering.
                        I finished my undergrad studies there, and managed to pass all courses in the last 5 semesters
                        with straight A's</p>
                    <p>After my undergraduate studies, I decided to pursue a research career in Software Engineering
                        abroad
                        to acquire knowledge in the state-of-the-art methods and tools in Software Engineering and be
                        able to
                        design a robust and reliable large-scale software system.</p>
                    <p>I was very fortunate to be accepted in a two-year master's program at the University of Waterloo
                        as it is one of the top
                        25 universities for Computer Engineering in the whole world. My research is under the
                        supervision of
                        <a target="_blank" href="https://www.patricklam.ca/">Dr. Patrick Lam</a>
                        and on the subject of Computer Software.
                    </p>
                    <p>I'm set to finish my grad studies by Fall 2023.</p>

                            <p>Abstract— A Program Synthesis tool automates the writing of computer programs based on a
                                set of specifications and constraints provided to the tool. In this paper, we outline
                                the development of a Boolean expression synthesis tool based upon the JS-Buxter tool
                                developed by author Mohammad Robati Shirzad. This automated program repair tool was
                                developed for resolving JavaScript bugs. It included support for the IF-CC bug fix
                                pattern, which focused on bugs related to if-condition statements. The JS-Buxter tool
                                used a “Brute-Force” approach, but it was clear that there could be a way to resolve
                                such bugs more efficiently. Since if-condition statements are activated based on a
                                Boolean result of some given variable(s), a Boolean expression synthesis tool would be
                                helpful in improving performance for the IF-CC bug fix pattern. This project is focused
                                on our development of such a Boolean expression synthesis tool. We provide background
                                information for the software and theoretical concepts we used in development of our
                                Boolean Expression Synthesis tool. These concepts are (in part) based upon the
                                Counterexample Guided Inductive Synthesis (CEGIS) approach. We developed two approaches
                                for program synthesis: “Feedback Only”, and “Feedback + Initial Probing”. We sought to
                                establish that these approaches achieved Boolean program synthesis much faster than a
                                “Brute-Force” Approach. All three approaches would take a set of variables and a set of
                                constraints as input. We collected data for all three approaches, for different levels
                                of expression depth. We analyzed the results of this data, and determined that these
                                feedback-based approaches achieved Boolean expression synthesis significantly faster
                                (more than 10 times faster for large inputs) than the “Brute-Force” approach.</p>
